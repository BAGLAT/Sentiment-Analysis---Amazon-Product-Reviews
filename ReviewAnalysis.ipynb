I thought buying an \"Official Samsung\" charger would be the best route to go.\\n\\nWith nothing running on my phone except Waze and Audible (my usual combo when driving) the battery icon showed charging on AC, BUT was losing power at the rate of 5% per hour.  On a long trip I was forced to turn the phone completely off for a few hours to get it to charge.  In fairness it could have been a defective unit but I won't be wasting time trying another of this model.\\n\\nThe company has been very accommodating in the return.

       "23    First, this is kind of cheap-looking, but I did try to buy the cheapest OEM car charger I could for my phone, so that's forgiveable.  The springs on the side don't have much force, though, so this is constantly slipping out of the 12V car port.  The cable is sturdy, but the rubber near the connector is kind of stiff, which makes charging AND operating your phone on the go a bit of a hassle.  It's held up well since I purchased it though.\\n\\nUPDATE:  Stopped charging after a month.                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

       "9970  I got this because I have an Otterbox Defender, which is great.  This isn't great.  It never felt like the rubber part of the case would stay on if it were dropped hard on the corner.  And the blue plastic over piece of the case cracked.  so it's now useless.  I got a Speck instead, and so far this feels much more secure.  So I like the Defender cases but the commuter isn't any good.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
