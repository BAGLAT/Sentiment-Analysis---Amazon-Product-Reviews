# Sentiment Analysis: Predicting Overall Ratings of Products using Customer Reviews

## Abstract
In the present era most of the data on the internet is in the form of raw text. These gold mines
of data are invaluable since it contains lots of underlying information which can be extracted using
natural language processing or text analytics techniques. Across all businesses, these data are being
used to find insights that help reduce operational costs and predict various future outcomes and
trends. The data from these text-based documents disclose usersâ€™ sentiments and opinions about a
particular subject. In this paper, customer reviews from Amazon.com are pre-processed, analysed,
and how these textual reviews justify the star ratings is studied. Features derived from textual reviews
are used to predict star ratings of the reviews. To accomplish it, the prediction problem is transformed
to a classification task to classify reviews to one of the five classes corresponding to its star rating.
The features which affect the ratings the most are also discussed.
